What does this plugin do?

Currently, not a lot really, it isn't fully working yet.
This plugin creates quests for your players to start and finish to get rewards and a higher level, which they can unlock new quests with. The quest part of this plugin is finished.

  Classes being added:
- Mage.
- Warrior.
- Tanker.
- Assassin.

Coming up:
- More classes people can play with.
- More quests, maybe configurable ones.
- Bug fixes of course.
