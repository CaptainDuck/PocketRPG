# PocketRPG


What does this plugin do?

This plugin makes your server an adventure.
PocketRPG creates classes, which people can play with in the world you have defined in the config.yml. In this world every class will have specialized weapons/abilities. Additionally, PocketRPG also adds quests, which you need a certain amount of exp. for to start, and those will reward the players with exp and gold(configurable) on completing. 

  Classes added:
- Mage.
- Warrior.
- Tanker.
- Assassin.

Coming up:
- Parties.
- 1v1 system built in the RPG.
- More classes people can play with.
- More quests, maybe configurable ones.
- Bug fixes of course.
