# PocketRPG


What does this plugin do?

This plugin makes your server an adventure.
PocketRPG creates classes, which people can play with in the world you have defined in the config.yml. In this world every class will have specialized weapons/abilities. Additionally, PocketRPG also adds quests, which you need a certain amount of exp. for to start, and those will reward the players with exp and gold(configurable) on completing. Party commands are included in this plugin. Being in the same party will stop you from attacking your friend.
You won't need any protection plugins to protect your RPG world. The RPG world you defined in the config.yml will be protected from breaking and placing automatically.

  Classes added:
- Mage.
- Warrior.
- Tanker.
- Assassin.

Coming up:
- More classes people can play with.
- More quests, maybe configurable ones.
- Bug fixes of course.
